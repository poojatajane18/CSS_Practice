    <h2>Fricional Biography</h2>
    <hr>
    <p>
        Following the success of the Fantastic Four in 1961 and the subsequent revival of superhero comic books, Marvel set about creating new superhero characters. 
        During this time, Stan Lee developed the initial concept for Iron Man. 
        Lee was interested in making an unlikeable character likeable, saying that he "thought it would be fun to take the kind of character that nobody would like, none of [Marvel's] readers would like, and shove him down their throats and make them like him". 
        Iron Man was created in the years after a permanent arms industry developed in the United States, and this was incorporated into the character's backstory. 
        The character was introduced as an active player in the Vietnam War. 
        Lee described the national mood toward Vietnam in which Iron Man was created as "a time when most of us genuinely felt that the conflict in that tortured land really was a simple matter of good versus evil".
